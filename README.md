#Poor Man's PCF

A simple implementation of Programming Computable Functions (simply-typed
lambda calculus with Y-combinator, natural numbers and booleans) + pairs and
lists. It consists of type checker and
evaluator. For simplicity, the implementation uses De Bruijn indices instead
of real variable names.

The example program takes a list of natural numbers and computes the
list of corresponding Fibonacci numbers.
