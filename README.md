#Poor Man's PCF

A simple implementation of Programming Computable Functions (simply-typed
lambda calculus with Y-combinator, natural numbers and booleans) + pairs,
lists, the unit type and sequencing. It consists of type checker and
evaluator. For simplicity, the implementation uses De Bruijn indices instead
of real variable names.
